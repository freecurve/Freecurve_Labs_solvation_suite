ARBALEST Molecular Dynamics Package and ARROW forcefield
---------------------------------------------------------

Inputs and running of Molecular Dynamics Simulations
----------------------------------------------------

1) System requirements: 
	There are two linux versions of the binaries: cuda and CPU only. the 
	CPU binary should run on recent UBUNTU systems and other linux flavors. 
	For any problems use the 'issues' in https://github.com/freecurve/solvation_examples repository
	if you wish to remain anonymous submit the links via and you can submit anonymous issues via 		https://gitreports.com/issue/freecurve/solvation_examples (will come as user 'freecurve')
	


	Post-processing scripts require MATLAB > R2017

2) Running examples: 
For solute hydration Classical MD simulations

Go to HydrationExamples
Go to MD sub-directory
Three examples of solute hydration a) methane b) water c) benzene
Go to these directories
	a) For MD calculation on CPU
		./run_cpu.sh 
	b) For MD calculation on GPU
		./run_gpu.sh

2) For solute hydration Path-Integral MD simulations

Go to HydrationExamples
Go to PIMD sub-directory
Three examples of solute hydration a) methane b) water c) benzene
        a) For PIMD calculation on CPU
                ./run_cpu.sh
        b) For PIMD calculation on GPU
                ./run_gpu.sh

The PIMD examples will run with 8 beads in H2O and 4 beads in CHEX

3) Post-processing and analysis: 


Helpful notes: 

a) The binaries for cpu and gpu version can be found in BIN:
Arbalest binaries revision 3364

-	ArbalestLight-FloatDoubleFixed-Cuda.r3364
	Cuda 10.2 is required to be installed
	Use '--gpu 1' option to run on GPU
	
-	ArbalestLight-FloatDoubleFixed.r3364
	Runs on CPU only	
	

b) use --help option to run Arbalest help, e.g.
$./ArbalestLight-FloatDoubleFixed.r3364 --help

Welcome to ARBALEST!
Executable file name: ./ArbalestLight-FloatDoubleFixed.r3364
Command line is: ./ArbalestLight-FloatDoubleFixed.r3364 --help
****** help output *****

b) The atom-typified input files for Methane, Benzene and water (HyperChemformat-HIN) can be found in HIN
